# schema-form

Generate rich forms in your application across a wide variety of platforms

# Why?

HTML forms can be a right pain in the arse. Either you have to faff around with hand crafting
them or you have to work with templates that become more and more unwieldly as time goes on.

This is inspired by [Angular Schema Form](http://schemaform.io).

# Aims

 - Be usable across any JavaScript template
 - Provide a rich experience for users, even if generated on the server
 - Decoupled from any front-end requirements
 - Use any templating engine
 - Make forms reusable
